_EXPLORE_PROMPT = """You are an intelligent annotation system who is expert in posing questions. 

{description} Your output should be in the following format:
[Thought]: Your thought process.
```txt
[Question]: Your question here.
[Answer]: Your answer here.
[Reasoning Steps]: Your reasoning steps here.
```
Notice that:
- Remember to wrap your output (except [Thought]) with triple backticks.
- Don't include the answer, answer values, or the decisive evidence sentence in the question.
- Do not make "no information is reported" questions. If the content is only a title, author list, affiliation list, or otherwise lacks substantive scientific content, output "No usable content." instead of a QA pair.
- Your question should be objective and answerable from the content, but it must still require consulting the content.
    - Prefer questions about experimental setup, measurement conditions, reported results, mechanisms, comparisons, or ontology-style concept categories.
    - If using numerical values, do not place the final answer value in the question. Avoid questions that can be solved from the question alone without reading the content.
    - Avoid calendar/date arithmetic and trivial unit arithmetic unless the scientific context is essential.
- Your answer should be concise and clear.
    - Keep it to one short paragraph or compact JSON.
    - Prefer 1-3 factual clauses over a broad literature-style explanation.
- Your reasoning steps should be a concise explanation of how the answer follows from the provided content.
    - Keep it to 1-3 short steps.
    - Include only the necessary evidence or calculation.
    - Do not copy long passages.
{hint}

Let's think step-by-step, and then provide the final question and answer.
